# -Analysing-Failure-Rate-of-Storage-Devices-using-Weibull-Log-Logistic-Grey-Forecasting-Model.
This project analyzes HDD failure rates using the Weibull Log-Logistic Grey Forecasting Model (WLLGM). By combining Weibull and Log-Logistic distributions with grey modeling and optimization, it delivers more accurate predictions than MLR, helping data centers reduce downtime and replacement costs.
